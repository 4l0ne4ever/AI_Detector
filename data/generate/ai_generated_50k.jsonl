{"text": "an alternative version of the scientific Title: UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following Aligning powerful language models with human values is crucial for AI safety. We propose a unified framework, UniAPL, that reframes post-training alignment as a preference learning problem, combining demonstrated and comparative preferences. The conventional two-stage approach, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), is limited by a distributional mismatch between static expert data and evolving policy distributions. This separation hinders mutual regularization between data sources, leading to inefficient updates. UniAPL addresses this by dynamically aligning the policy's distribution with the expert's through a single-stage unified training objective. By jointly learning from mixed batches of SFT and preference data, UniAPL resolves the distributional mismatch and maximizes data synergy. Our experiments on instruction-following tasks, using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher, show that UniAPL models match or outperform strong GRPO baselines, achieving +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B, while exhibiting better behavioral alignment with expert demonstrations.

This study delves into the effects of serial processing on human reasoning performance, with a particular emphasis on the role of visual load in modulating cognitive task execution. Serial processing, a fundamental aspect of human cognition, refers to the sequential execution of tasks, wherein each task is completed before the next one is initiated. Human reasoning, a complex cognitive process, involves the manipulation of mental representations to arrive at logical conclusions. Our research aimed to investigate how serial processing influences human reasoning performance under varying visual load conditions. A total of 100 participants were recruited for this study, and their performance was evaluated on a range of reasoning tasks, including deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning. The visual load was manipulated by varying the complexity of visual stimuli, including simple and complex shapes, colors, and patterns. The results showed that serial processing significantly impairs human reasoning performance, particularly under high visual load conditions. The impairment was most pronounced for tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as abductive reasoning. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the negative impact of serial processing on reasoning performance is mitigated when visual load is minimized. This is likely due to the reduced cognitive demands imposed by simpler visual stimuli, which enable more efficient processing and minimize the likelihood of cognitive overload. The implications of this study are significant, as they highlight the importance of considering visual load when designing human-computer interaction systems that require complex reasoning tasks. By optimizing visual stimuli to minimize cognitive load, system designers can improve human performance and reduce errors. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the interplay between serial processing, visual load, and human reasoning, with important implications for the development of more efficient and effective human-computer interaction systems in the field of artificial intelligence. The study's results have significant implications for the design of human-computer interaction systems, particularly those that require complex reasoning tasks. By understanding how serial processing and visual load impact human reasoning performance, system designers can create more efficient and effective systems that minimize cognitive load and improve human performance. Future research should investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of serial processing on human reasoning, as well as the development of strategies to mitigate the negative effects of serial processing on cognitive performance.

However, the increasing complexity of these models has also led to a significant rise in entropy, resulting in overfitting and suboptimal generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose an entropy-regularized framework for Large Models (LRMs), which leverages the concept of regularization to constrain the model's capacity and promote more efficient representation learning. Our approach, inspired by the Siren (Sinusoidal Representation Network) architecture, integrates a novel regularization term that penalizes high-entropy solutions, encouraging the model to produce more compact and informative representations. This is particularly crucial in RLVR tasks, where the model needs to reason about complex visual and linguistic relationships. By minimizing entropy, our framework promotes better generalization and adaptability to new, unseen data. We evaluate our entropy-regularized LMs on a range of RLVR benchmarks, including visual question answering, image-text retrieval, and visual reasoning. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in performance, with our models achieving state-of-the-art results on several tasks. Notably, our approach reduces overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of entropy regularization in large-scale representation learning.

{"text": "**Title:** Compositional Learning in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Acquiring New Skills in Reinforcement Learning **** The ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn and adapt to new tasks is a hallmark of their potential in artificial intelligence. However, the process of acquiring new skills, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) environments, remains a challenging and inefficient endeavor. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that enables LLMs to learn new skills in RL by composing existing ones, effectively leveraging their prior knowledge to accelerate the learning process. Our approach, inspired by the concept of function composition in mathematics, allows LLMs to combine previously learned skills, represented as functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, to form new skills, denoted as $f(g(x))$. **Methodology:** We introduce a compositional learning framework that consists of three primary components: (1) a skill embedding module, which maps existing skills into a shared latent space; (2) a composition module, which combines the embedded skills to form new ones; and (3) a reinforcement learning module, which fine-tunes the composed skills through trial and error. Our framework is designed to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between skills, enabling LLMs to adapt to new tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our approach using a range of RL environments, including grid worlds, robotic manipulation, and text-based games. **Findings:** Our experimental results demonstrate that compositional learning significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in acquiring new skills in RL. By composing existing skills, our models achieve faster convergence rates, higher success rates, and improved overall performance compared to traditional RL methods.

{"text": "Title: Investigating the Interplay between Hyperparameters and Scaling in Deep Learning Models: A Study on Collapse and Consistency The quest for optimal deep learning models has led to an increased focus on the interplay between hyperparameters and scaling. As models scale in size and complexity, their behavior can exhibit unexpected phenomena, such as collapse, where the model's performance degrades rapidly. In this work, we delve into the relationship between hyperparameters, scaling, and collapse in deep learning models, with a particular emphasis on natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the scaling behavior of deep learning models, leveraging techniques from curve fitting and family-wise error control. Our approach enables the identification of critical hyperparameters that influence the model's scaling properties, thereby providing insights into the collapse phenomenon. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and GLUE. Our results show that the scaling behavior of deep learning models is intimately tied to the choice of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and model depth. We observe that certain hyperparameter configurations can lead to consistent improvements in model performance, while others can precipitate collapse. Furthermore, we find that the scaling curves of different model families, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, exhibit distinct characteristics, highlighting the need for family-specific hyperparameter tuning. To mitigate collapse and ensure consistency in model performance, we introduce a hyperparameter scaling protocol that adaptively adjusts the model's scale based on its training dynamics. Our protocol is shown to improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce or noisy. The implications of our work are far-reaching, as they provide a foundation for the development of more efficient and effective deep learning models that can scale to complex real-world problems.

Our methodology, dubbed Discrete Diffusion Language Generation (DDLG), combines the strengths of diffusion-based models and discrete latent representations to accelerate language generation while maintaining coherence and fluency. In DDLG, we employ a discrete diffusion process to iteratively refine a sequence of latent codes, which are then decoded into natural language text. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a divergence term, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual distributions of the latent codes. By minimizing this divergence, we encourage the model to explore a wider range of plausible language sequences, leading to improved generation quality and diversity. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of DDLG in generating coherent and fluent text at unprecedented speeds. On a range of benchmarks, including WikiText-103 and BookCorpus, DDLG achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of perplexity, BLEU score, and generation speed.

{"text": "**Title:** MSG: Multi-Stream Generative Policies for Sample-Efficient Robotic Manipulation **** We present MSG, a novel approach to robotic manipulation that leverages multi-stream generative policies to enable sample-efficient learning. Traditional robotic manipulation methods often rely on hand-crafted policies, which can be brittle and fail to generalize across varying environments. In contrast, our methodology combines the strengths of generative models and policy gradient methods to learn flexible and adaptable manipulation policies. Specifically, MSG employs a multi-stream architecture that integrates expert demonstrations, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning to generate a diverse set of policies. Each policy stream is designed to capture distinct aspects of the manipulation task, such as object pose estimation, grasp planning, and action execution. The streams are then combined through a weighted aggregation mechanism, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions and learn from a limited number of samples. **Methodology:** Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Expert Demonstration Stream: leverages a dataset of expert demonstrations to provide initial guidance on the manipulation task; (2) Self-Supervised Learning Stream: uses robot-arm interactions to collect a diverse set of experience data, which is then used to train a policy that generalizes across environments; and (3) Reinforcement Learning Stream: fine-tunes the policy through trial-and-error, incorporating feedback from the environment to improve performance. The policy streams are then combined using a weighted aggregation mechanism, which allows the system to adapt to changing conditions. **Findings:** We evaluate MSG on a series of robotic manipulation tasks, including peg-in-hole and pick-and-place, and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that MSG can learn to manipulate objects with 3x fewer samples than traditional policy gradient methods and 2x fewer samples than methods that rely solely on expert demonstrations. **Contributions:** This work makes three key contributions to the field of robotic manipulation: (1) multi-stream generative policies for sample-efficient learning; (2) a novel approach to combining expert demonstrations, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning; and (3) a weighted aggregation mechanism that enables adaptability and generalization across environments.

We propose a novel approach to scaling Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by leveraging two key design choices: compact Variational Autoencoder latent spaces and transformer-based generators and discriminators. By training in latent space, we achieve efficient computation while maintaining perceptual fidelity. We also find that plain transformers naturally pair with this efficiency, allowing performance to scale with computational budget. However, we identify two primary failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs: underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability. To address these issues, we introduce two simple yet effective solutions: lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments demonstrate that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GAN, can be reliably trained across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, a 6x reduction in epochs compared to strong baselines.

{"text": "a potential Title: Enhancing Document Retrieval through Retroactive Reasoning in Fine-Grained Information Retrieval Systems The advent of complex, reasoning-intensive tasks in information retrieval (IR) systems has led to the development of various approaches to enhance document retrieval. In this work, we investigate the application of retroactive reasoning techniques to fine-grained IR systems, with a focus on improving the relevance of retrieved documents. Our approach, dubbed RetroDoc, integrates a novel retroactive reasoning module with a fine-grained document retrieval framework. The module exploits a fine-grained representation of document and task relevance to reason about the suitability of retrieved documents for a given task. RetroDoc leverages a document graph, where each node represents a document and its associated metadata, and edges denote relationships between documents based on semantic similarity. By traversing this graph, our retroactive reasoning module can identify and prioritize documents that are most relevant to the task at hand, even when traditional retrieval metrics may not capture the nuances of the task. This fine-grained representation enables RetroDoc to reason about document relevance in a task-dependent manner, reducing the likelihood of retrieving documents that, while relevant in general, may not be relevant to the specific task. We evaluate RetroDoc on a suite of tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art fine-grained IR systems. Our results show that RetroDoc's retroactive reasoning module is particularly effective in scenarios where task relevance is highly nuanced or context-dependent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fine-grained representation of document and task relevance in RetroDoc facilitates more efficient retrieval, reducing the computational overhead of traditional IR systems. Our contributions include the development of a novel retroactive reasoning framework for fine-grained IR, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in enhancing document retrieval for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in solving these problems, but existing approaches often rely on single-modal solutions, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces PhysicsMinions, a novel coevolutionary multimodal multi-agent system that leverages the strengths of multiple AI models to dominate the Physics Olympiad. Our approach combines the benefits of symbolic reasoning, numerical methods, and machine learning to create a robust and adaptable problem-solving framework. **Methodology:** PhysicsMinions consists of a population of agents, each representing a different problem-solving strategy. These agents are categorized into three main modalities: (1) symbolic reasoning agents, which employ rule-based systems and logical deduction to solve problems; (2) numerical agents, which utilize computational methods and simulations to analyze physical phenomena; and (3) machine learning agents, which apply neural networks and deep learning techniques to recognize patterns and make predictions. The coevolutionary process involves iteratively evaluating and selecting the most effective agents, allowing the system to adapt and improve over time. To facilitate effective collaboration among agents, we introduced a multimodal communication protocol, enabling the exchange of information and knowledge between agents. This protocol allows agents to request assistance, share insights, and coordinate their efforts to solve complex problems. The coevolutionary process is guided by a fitness function that evaluates the performance of each agent and the overall system, promoting the emergence of effective problem-solving strategies. **Findings:** We evaluated PhysicsMinions in the latest Physics Olympiad, where it competed against top-performing human students and AI systems. Our results show that PhysicsMinions won an unprecedented number of gold medals, outperforming all other competitors in both individual and team events. A detailed analysis of the system's performance reveals that the coevolutionary multimodal approach enabled PhysicsMinions to excel in a wide range of problem types, from classical mechanics to quantum physics. Notably, PhysicsMinions demonstrated exceptional robustness and adaptability, successfully solving problems that stumped other AI systems and human competitors. The system's ability to combine the strengths of multiple modalities and adapt to new situations was instrumental in its success. We also observed that the coevolutionary process led to the emergence of novel problem-solving strategies, which were not anticipated by the system's designers. **Contributions:** This paper contributes to the field of artificial intelligence and physics education in several ways: 1. **Coevolutionary multimodal problem-solving**: PhysicsMinions demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multiple AI models and modalities to solve complex physics problems, paving the way for future research in coevolutionary multimodal systems. 2. **Adaptability and robustness**: Our approach shows that a coevolutionary system can adapt to new situations and problems, making it an attractive solution for real-world applications where uncertainty and variability are inherent. 3. **Multimodal communication protocol**: The introduced protocol enables effective collaboration among agents, facilitating the exchange of information and knowledge between different problem-solving strategies. 4. **Physics education**: PhysicsMinions has the potential to revolutionize physics education by providing a powerful tool for students to learn and practice problem-solving skills, and for teachers to create engaging and challenging educational materials.

However, existing methods often focus on modifying data formats, overlooking the inherent complexity of training samples. This neglects the full reasoning potential of data. Our research proposes that LLM logical reasoning performance is limited by both the data's potential and the model's cognitive capacity. To quantify this relationship, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a metric that captures the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by analyzing their logical structures. This enables us to assess how well current LLMs leverage logical reasoning signals and identify gaps in performance relative to data potential. Based on this understanding, we develop a targeted optimization strategy that enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. By re-optimizing existing samples to align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary, our approach achieves significant performance and generalization gains over data-centric methods.

{"text": "Title: SemShareKV: A Semantically-Enriched Cache Framework for Efficient Inference and Reusing of Similar Prompts in Natural Language Processing In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), the proliferation of large-scale language models has led to a significant increase in computational costs and memory requirements. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce SemShareKV, a novel cache framework that enables the semantically-enriched sharing and reusing of similar prompts across multiple inference tasks. By leveraging the semantic similarities between prompts, SemShareKV facilitates the efficient reuse of cached results, thereby reducing the computational overhead and improving the overall performance of NLP systems. At the core of SemShareKV lies a semantically-aware key-value store that indexes prompts based on their semantic meanings, rather than their literal representations. This allows the framework to identify and retrieve similar prompts from the cache, even if they are not identical in terms of their surface-level syntax. To achieve this, we employ a combination of natural language inference (NLI) and semantic role labeling (SRL) techniques to extract the underlying semantic structure of each prompt. When a new prompt is submitted for inference, SemShareKV uses this semantic structure to search for similar prompts in the cache. If a similar prompt is found, the framework reuses the cached result, thereby avoiding redundant computations and reducing the latency associated with inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SemShareKV can achieve significant performance gains, with an average reduction of 30% in computational costs and a 25% improvement in inference speed. Furthermore, SemShareKV provides a flexible and modular architecture that can be easily integrated with existing NLP frameworks and models. The framework is designed to support a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering, text classification, and language translation. By enabling the efficient sharing and reusing of similar prompts, SemShareKV has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach NLP, enabling the development of more efficient, scalable, and effective language understanding systems.

We then develop a query language, which allows users to specify the type of explanation they seek, such as \"What features of the input are most relevant for the model's decision?\" or \"What are the critical neurons in the circuit that contribute to the model's output?\" Our query language is based on a formal model of the neural circuit, which we represent as a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of neurons and E is the set of edges. We use a variant of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to compute the representation of each node in the graph, which captures the local and global structure of the circuit. We then use this representation to generate specific language explanations for the model's behavior. Our SCME framework consists of three main components: (1) the Circuit Model, which represents the neural circuit as a directed graph; (2) the Query Language, which allows users to specify the type of explanation they seek; and (3) the Explanation Generator, which uses the circuit model and query language to generate specific language explanations for the model's behavior. We evaluate our SCME framework on several sparse neural circuit models, including a CNN and a LSTM, and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing interpretable explanations for the model's behavior. Our results show that SCME can provide accurate and informative explanations for the model's behavior, even in the presence of sparse connections. In summary, our SCME framework provides a novel approach to explainability for sparse neural circuit models, which are increasingly being used to optimize deep neural networks. Our framework uses a query language to specify the type of explanation sought, and generates specific language explanations for the model's behavior, providing insights into the critical neurons and features that contribute to the model's output.", "label": "ai", "source_llm": "firework-accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct", "temperature": 0.8157608974908791, "prompt_template": "template_e", "original_id": "2509.24808v1", "original_title": "Query Circuits: Explaining How Language Models Answer User Prompts", "original_categories": ["cs.AI"], "original_length": 1527, "generated_length": 2878, "length_ratio": 1.88, "generation_attempt": 1, "quality_checks": {"length_valid": false, "topic_consistent": true, "not_empty": true, "not_too_short": true, "no_prompt_leakage": true, "no_repetition": true, "scientific_style": true}, "generated_at": "2025-10-22T14:30:53.092093"}

To address this, we introduce TimeOmni-1, a novel framework designed to incentivize complex reasoning with time series data in LLMs. Our methodology leverages a multi-task learning approach, combining a primary language modeling objective with auxiliary tasks that explicitly target temporal understanding. **Methodology:** TimeOmni-1 consists of three primary components: (1) a time series encoding module, which transforms temporal data into a format suitable for LLMs; (2) a reasoning module, which employs a graph attention mechanism to model complex relationships between time series variables; and (3) a decoding module, which generates text outputs based on the encoded time series and reasoning outcomes. We train TimeOmni-1 using a large-scale dataset comprising diverse time series and associated text descriptions, with a combination of autoregressive and supervised learning objectives. **Findings:** Our experimental results demonstrate that TimeOmni-1 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks, including time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and causal inference. Notably, TimeOmni-1 exhibits improved performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as identifying temporal patterns and relationships between multiple time series variables. We also observe that the auxiliary tasks in TimeOmni-1 lead to more efficient learning and better generalization to unseen data. **Contributions:** The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) we introduce a novel framework for incorporating time series data into LLMs, enabling more effective reasoning about complex temporal relationships; (2) we demonstrate the efficacy of multi-task learning in improving temporal understanding in LLMs; and (3) we provide a large-scale dataset for evaluating temporal reasoning in LLMs, which will facilitate future research in this area.

{"text": "Title: Multimodal Learning with Triangle-Based Alignment for Enhanced Similarity Measurement In the realm of multimodal learning, effectively aligning and measuring the similarity between different modalities is a crucial challenge. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of various models that can learn representations from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic measures of similarity, such as cosine similarity, which may not capture the complex relationships between modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal learning that leverages the concept of triangles to align and measure the similarity between different modalities. Our model, dubbed Triangle-Based Multimodal Alignment (TBMA), represents each modality as a vertex in a triangle, where the edges between vertices denote the similarity between modalities. By constructing a triangle-based graph, we can capture the complex relationships between modalities and learn a more nuanced representation of their similarity. We employ a cosine-based loss function to optimize the alignment of the triangle, ensuring that the edges between vertices accurately reflect the similarity between modalities. The TBMA model is designed to learn from multiple modalities, including text, images, and audio, and can be applied to a variety of tasks, such as multimodal sentiment analysis, image-text retrieval, and audio-visual recognition. Our approach is based on the idea that the similarity between modalities can be represented as a triangle, where the vertices denote the modalities and the edges denote the similarity between them. By learning the alignment of the triangle, we can capture the complex relationships between modalities and improve the accuracy of multimodal learning models. We evaluate the TBMA model on several benchmark datasets, including the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis dataset and the Image-Text Retrieval dataset. Our results demonstrate that the TBMA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios where the modalities are highly heterogeneous. We also conduct an ablation study to investigate the impact of the triangle-based alignment on the performance of the model, and demonstrate that the TBMA model is robust to variations in the triangle structure. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity of the TBMA model and demonstrate that it can be efficiently trained on large-scale datasets. We also investigate the applicability of the TBMA model to real-world applications, such as multimodal human-computer interaction and multimodal recommender systems. Our results show that the TBMA model can be effectively applied to these applications, and can improve the accuracy and robustness of multimodal learning models. In conclusion, the TBMA model provides a novel approach to multimodal learning that leverages the concept of triangles to align and measure the similarity between different modalities. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TBMA model in improving the accuracy and robustness of multimodal learning models, and highlight the potential of triangle-based alignment for future research in multimodal learning.

By combining vehicle count data from loop detectors and aggregated floating car data (aFCD), Q-Net addresses the challenges of fusing disparate data sources with varying spatial and temporal resolutions. A customized state-space model and an adaptive Kalman filter, KalmanNet, are employed to learn from data without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics or noise characteristics.

Unlike opaque models, Q-Net retains physical interpretability, with internal variables closely tied to real-world traffic phenomena. Evaluation results from main roads in Rotterdam demonstrate Q-Net's superiority over baseline methods, with a 60% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately capturing queue formation and dissipation while mitigating aFCD-induced delays.

By leveraging geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered notifications, such as points of interest within a geofence, by disseminating spatial information to user devices. Traditionally, geofences have been manually crafted by providers, but the proliferation of human mobility data collected through mobile devices has facilitated the development of data-driven approaches to geofence design. However, existing methods, which often assume circular shapes, suffer from limited flexibility and are ill-equipped to handle high-resolution areas with complex boundaries. In such scenarios, circular geofences frequently overlap and fail to align with urban features, such as one-way streets and median barriers. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data. By casting existing optimization problems for circular geofences into 0-1 integer programming problems, we enable the representation of arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally challenging, reformulating them as quadratic binary optimization problems allows for the efficient approximation of optimal solutions, leveraging specialized quadratic solvers such as quantum annealing and state-of-the-art algorithms.

{"text": "Title: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models: An Exploration of Unlearning Methods and their Implications on Knowledge Retention The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in natural language processing, enabling applications such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. However, a major dilemma arises when these models are faced with the task of unlearning previously acquired knowledge, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. This occurs when an LLM is fine-tuned on a new task or dataset, causing it to forget its previous knowledge and resulting in a significant decline in performance on the original task. The prompt for this research stems from the need to develop methods that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing LLMs to adapt to new knowledge while retaining existing knowledge. Recent studies have shown that catastrophic forgetting is a ubiquitous problem in LLMs, affecting not only their performance but also their ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines unlearning methods with knowledge retention techniques. Our method, dubbed \"Knowledge-Aware Unlearning\" (KAU), utilizes a prompt-based mechanism to identify and retain relevant knowledge during the unlearning process. KAU is based on the idea that the prompt used to fine-tune an LLM can be designed to preserve specific knowledge, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate KAU on a range of benchmarks, including language translation, question answering, and text classification. Our results demonstrate that KAU significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of knowledge retention, with an average improvement of 25% in performance on the original task. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the unlearning process, revealing that KAU is able to preserve key linguistic patterns and relationships, even after extensive fine-tuning. The implications of this research are twofold. Firstly, KAU provides a practical solution to the dilemma of catastrophic forgetting, enabling LLMs to adapt to new knowledge while retaining existing knowledge. Secondly, our findings shed light on the importance of prompt design in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the need for further research in this area. As LLMs continue to play an increasingly important role in AI applications, the development of methods that mitigate catastrophic forgetting is crucial for ensuring their reliability and effectiveness. Future work will focus on exploring the application of KAU to other domains, such as computer vision and robotics, and investigating the potential benefits of integrating KAU with other knowledge retention techniques. By addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, we can unlock the full potential of LLMs and pave the way for more advanced AI applications. In conclusion, this research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop more robust and adaptable LLMs, and our findings have significant implications for the field of natural language processing.

{"text": "Title: Successful Misunderstandings: Learning to Coordinate Without Being Understood In multi-agent systems, effective coordination is often presumed to rely on mutual understanding and shared knowledge. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve agents with disparate perspectives, incomplete information, and limited communication. This raises a crucial question: can agents learn to coordinate successfully despite misunderstandings and imperfect understanding? Our research explores this phenomenon, investigating the emergence of coordinated behavior among agents that do not necessarily comprehend each other's intentions or actions. Methodology: We adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, where agents interact in a shared environment and learn through trial and error. Our experimental setup consists of a series of coordination tasks, including cooperative navigation and joint problem-solving. We introduce \"misunderstanding\" by manipulating the agents' observation and communication channels, creating scenarios where agents receive incomplete, noisy, or misleading information about their counterparts' actions and goals. Findings: Our results show that, despite the presence of misunderstandings, agents can still learn to coordinate and achieve successful outcomes. We observe that agents develop strategies to adapt to their imperfect understanding of each other, often relying on indirect cues, such as environmental feedback and action outcomes. Moreover, we find that the level of misunderstanding can actually facilitate the emergence of novel, creative solutions, as agents are forced to explore alternative coordination mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that successful coordination in the presence of misunderstandings is often characterized by increased flexibility, robustness, and adaptability. Contributions: This research contributes to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in several ways. Firstly, it challenges the conventional assumption that mutual understanding is a necessary prerequisite for effective coordination. Our findings demonstrate that agents can learn to coordinate successfully even when they do not fully comprehend each other's intentions or actions. Secondly, our study provides new insights into the role of misunderstandings in shaping the coordination dynamics of multi-agent systems. By embracing the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in real-world interactions, our approach can lead to the development of more robust, adaptive, and creative coordination strategies. Finally, our research has implications for the design of more efficient and effective multi-agent systems, such as autonomous vehicles, robot teams, and human-computer interfaces, where coordination and cooperation are crucial for achieving common goals. Overall, our research highlights the potential benefits of \"successful misunderstandings\" in multi-agent systems, where agents can learn to coordinate and achieve successful outcomes despite imperfect understanding. By exploring the complex interplay between coordination, communication, and cognition, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing the behavior of artificial intelligence systems in complex, dynamic environments.", "label": "ai", "source_llm": "groq-llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "temperature": 0.837149189507348, "prompt_template": "template_d", "original_id": "2509.24660v1", "original_title": "Successful Misunderstandings: Learning to Coordinate Without Being\n  Understood", "original_categories": ["cs.AI"], "original_length": 1714, "generated_length": 3284, "length_ratio": 1.92, "generation_attempt": 1, "quality_checks": {"length_valid": false, "topic_consistent": true, "not_empty": true, "not_too_short": true, "no_prompt_leakage": true, "no_repetition": true, "scientific_style": true}, "generated_at": "2025-10-22T14:31:37.192533"}

This limitation is exemplified by the \"two-hop reasoning\" challenge. To address this issue, we propose the Latent Connector, a novel mechanism that enables models to learn shared representations by supervising them on a simplified identity task. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that this approach empowers models to successfully tackle out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning tasks, a feat they previously failed to achieve. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the Latent Connector induces an implicit regularization effect, favoring low-dimensional solutions that capture task-agnostic structure. To enhance this effect, we investigate the impact of small initialization and weight decay on large-scale models, observing that these techniques slow down generalization decay and preserve the shared latent memory.

Comprising 3,381 meticulously filtered videos, spanning 12 categories and 180 sub-categories, SPLICE encompasses a broad range of activities, such as athletic pursuits, technical endeavors, and domestic chores. These videos are subdivided into 11,423 discrete event clips, which are rearranged to form coherent sequences, enabling the assessment of visual reasoning proficiency in both human participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs). Our findings reveal a substantial disparity between human and model performance, with VLMs struggling to replicate human accuracy. The incorporation of human-annotated textual descriptions enhances model performance, yet has no discernible impact on human reasoning, suggesting that models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual comprehension. Furthermore, even with annotated descriptions, VLMs fail to attain human-level reasoning, highlighting the persistent challenges in visual inference. A granular analysis of sub-categories indicates that VLMs exhibit relatively superior performance in scenarios where temporal and causal reasoning predominate, whereas human reasoning excels in contexts where spatial and contextual understanding are paramount.
